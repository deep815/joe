WalletGen is a program for generating crypto wallets such as Bitcoin and EVM (ETH, BNB, MATIC, e.t.c), 
as well as searching for forgotten/lost wallets with an existing balance.

The speed of generating wallets exceeds the speed of programs written in python several times and 
depends more on your graphics card.

I hope you will share a small part of your find.
